#Now what if we wanted to make our own functions?
#we first start out with a keyword, which is called def. And this is because we're creating or defining our function.
#Now, after the def keyword,we can give our function a name and I'm just going to call it my_function.
#Now, the thing that differentiates a function from a variable, however,is the parentheses. 
#So after the name comes the parentheses,and now the final thing, 
#the finishing touch to our function definition is a colon because that says everything that 
#comes after that line and is indented belongs with the function.
