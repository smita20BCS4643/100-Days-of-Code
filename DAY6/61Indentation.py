#I've been talking about spaces and actually there's two ways of creating indentation. 
# You don't have to just use spaces.
# You can also use tabs and that's created using the tab key on your keyboard,
# which can look a little bit like this. Now there's a lot of debate around spaces and tabs 
# where some people prefer using spaces to indent, other people prefer tabs to indent.
